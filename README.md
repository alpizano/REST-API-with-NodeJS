# Setup
Created a directory to hold your REST API source code, I am using ```rest-api-shop``` here

Inside directory, run ```npm init```

Open the package.json file with an IDE, i.e. Visual Studio Code

Open the terminal using Ctrl+` (Visual Studio Code) and inside rest-api-shop directory run ```npm install --save express```, as we will use the express framework to aid in API build.
